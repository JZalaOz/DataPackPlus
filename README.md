# DataPackPlus

This is a Fabric Minecraft mod which adds a few features which are useful to Minecraft Datapack developers.

```
/data math <operation> storage <identifier>
/data math <operation> storage <identifier> <path>
/data math <operation> test <nbt>
```

I have to improve this read me at one point, this just makes it easy to do math operations fast and later grab variables 
that are slow or not possible with datapacks like set/get player velocity/motion
